1. Define modulation and explain its purpose in wireless communication.  
Answer:  Modulation is changing a signal to send data.  
 
Final Score: 1.5/4
Max Score: 4
Feedback: Please try adding more details in your explanation of how modulation works! For example, you could mention that this involves changing things like amplitude or frequency to send data over different channels without interference.
Percentage: 37.5%
Justification: * The student's answer mentions "modulation" which matches one key concept from the model answer. However, it lacks specificity about what modulation entails (varying carrier signals' properties).

2. Calculate the path loss at a distance of 500  meters for a signal frequency of 2 GHz in 
free space.  
Answer:  Path loss at 500 m for 2 GHz is approximately 92.45 dB.  
 
 
Final Score: 2.0/4
Max Score: 4
Feedback: Please include more details in your calculation. Explain that you are plugging in given distances of 500 meters and frequencies at 2 GHz into an equation, which is:  
FSPL (dB) = 20 * log10(d) + 20 * log10(f).
Percentage: 50.0%
Justification: - The student's answer correctly states the path loss value (approximately correct).
- However, it lacks key concepts from the model answer such as explaining how to calculate FSPL using a formula and providing specific values for distance 'd' and frequency 'f'.
