Define modulation and explain its purpose in wireless communication.  
Answer: Modulation is changing a signal to send data.  
Calculate the path loss at a distance of 500 meters for a signal frequency of 2 
GHz in free space.  
Answer: Path loss at 500 m for 2 GHz is approximately 92. 45 dB.  
Explain the concept of bandwidth in wireless communication and differentiate 
between narrowband and wideband signals.  
Answer:  Bandwidth is the range of frequencies.  
What is Doppler Shift, and how does it impact mobile wireless communication?  
Answer: Doppler Shift is a change in frequency.  
Explain MIMO technology and calculate the capacity of a 2x2 MIMO system 
with a signal -to-noise ratio of 20 dB.  
Answer: MIMO uses multiple antennas.  
Final Score: 2/4
Max Score: 4
Feedback: Please make sure to include all relevant information about wireless communication topics like Bandwidth when answering questions related to mobile devices or technologies such as MIMO systems
Percentage: 50.0%
Justification: The student's answer mentions two key concepts from the model:

1. Doppler Shift (correctly identified as "a change in frequency")
2. Multiple Input, Multiple Output technology and its capacity calculation.

However, they missed mentioning bandwidth range of frequencies.
