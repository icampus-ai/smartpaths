    Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. The main products of photosynthesis are glucose (a form of chemical energy) and oxygen. 
    The process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where light energy is absorbed and used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Chlorophyll plays a key role in absorbing light.
